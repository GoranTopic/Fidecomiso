# Fidecomiso-LatinTrust
A GUI program for calculating the risk of a given client. I was made Using C# and WPS on Visual Studio.

It was created as a solution for the tedious manul work work which the accountantas of LatinTrust would have to do.

The GUI promps the user question about the client. 

Then it calculates the risk and graphs it to match. Saving the informations in a django back-end server.
